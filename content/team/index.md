We are a group of "Azurers". People with their heads in the Cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è and passionate about building amazing stuff on the [Microsoft Azure Platform](https://azure.com). Together we run the [Azure Z√ºrich](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Microsoft-Azure-Zurich-User-Group/) and [Azure Bern](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Azure-Cloud-Bern-User-Group/) user groups with the goal to unite everyone from Azure newbie to expert, from developer to IT-pro and from startup to enterprise. If you are interested in Cloud Computing with Microsoft, join our meetups or get in contact via Twitter at [@AzureZurich](https://twitter.com/azurezurich) and [@AzureBern](https://twitter.com/azurebern).
