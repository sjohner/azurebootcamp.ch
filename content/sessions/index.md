⭐️ **RUNNING AZURE FUNCTIONS @ BKW**  
Consider the cloud being nothing but the perfect runtime environment for running functions and services of any size. [BKW](https://www.bkw.ch/) is using Azure Functions extensively in order to integrate systems and components in the cloud and on-premise. This approach replaces the usage of large middleware systems completely. BKW benefits in many ways: cost reduction, flexibility and stability. How are we doing it?
