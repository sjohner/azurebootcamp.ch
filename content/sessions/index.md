### <a name="digitec"></a> ⭐️ Navigating the Azure Cloud at Digitec Galaxus: Our Journey and Lessons Learned
Our story starts in 2015 with our on-prem .NET monolith running on Windows Server, accompanied by a single, clunky MS SQL database, powered by fusion-io disks and many other touchable hardware in a server-room - all built-up with about 5 teams back then. Today, our system is highly distributed and modular, entirely operating in the cloud, and processing significantly more data. It is continuously developed and maintained by over 45 Scrum teams. In our talk, we will delve into our experiences spanning the last 9 years – discussing how we work and organize ourselves, tracing the evolution of our system architecture up to the present, and, of course, exploring the role Azure plays in it all. Spoiler: not everything has always gone according to plan…

### <a name="entraid"></a> ⭐️ Kill your IAM system now - Entra ID is here!
Identity and access management (IAM) requirements have dramatically changed in the last years. With more and more companies heavily consuming cloud apps, new tools and processes are needed to address modern IAM needs. In this session, Marcel Zehner, a long-term Microsoft MVP and Regional Director, will demonstrate from real-world business cases, how comprehensive IAM solution can be build with Entra ID instead of using clumsy, cumbersome, not-so-modern IAM solutions.

### <a name="copilotera"></a> ⭐️ The Era of Copilots - PoV from Microsoft
In this session, the Microsoft team will give you an insight into the world of Copilots. After a brief overview, we will show you different variants of how you can build your own Copilots and what tools and services are available. Finally, we will give you an outlook on possibilities in the area of Semantic Kernel, which are still in the "experimental state".

### <a name="owndataopenai"></a> ⭐️ OpenAI models with your own data using Azure OpenAI
Large language models (LLMs) excel at tasks related to natural language processing such as writing, summarization or translation. At the same time, despite their obvious strengths, these models suffer from certain limitations, which can make it difficult to integrate them directly into our custom business workflows or applications. In particular they are confined to the data they were originally trained, so they would not know about specialized domains or our own internal data, and they are prone to hallucination (“making stuff up”).
However, it's possible to extend their reasoning to any custom, business- or domain-specific data set, opening avenues for more personalized, insightful and reliable integrations.
This session focuses on GPT models from OpenAI and explores the essential architectural components within Azure that support such integrations, outlining how to use these models in our own products and services.

### <a name="breachingcloud"></a> ⭐️ Breaching the Cloud: How to Exploit and Mitigate Common Security Risks
The session will concentrate on typical cloud security risks relevant to Azure environments that fall under the customer's responsibility. We will then demonstrate how an attacker could exploit these risks to gain unauthorised access to cloud infrastructure. Finally, we will propose preventive measures to mitigate these risks.

### <a name="gptowndata"></a> ⭐️ ChatGPT over your own data
As the demand for intelligent chatbots grows, organizations seek ways to tailor these conversational agents to their specific needs. In this session, we explore how to create a private ChatGPT instance that leverages your own data. Whether you’re building a customer support bot, an internal knowledge base, or a specialized domain-specific assistant, understanding the architecture and data requirements is crucial.

### <a name="mobichatgpt"></a> ⭐️ Mobi-ChatGPT & Friends - or how to integrate enterprise ready Gen-AI at scale
Experience an exciting journey into the world of artificial intelligence. In this session, we will focus on generative AI and show you how to fully leverage the potential of such technologies with a focus on large language models (LLMs). We will exemplify this with practical examples of how we implement Gen-AI use cases at La Mobilière (Mobi-ChatGPT and more).

But that's not all! We will also provide quick history of Gen-AI, an insight into the world of generative AI models and explain how they differ from classical models. We will show you how to integrate LLMs with your own data and how such models will shape the future of how we work with artificial intelligence.

Sounds good? This was generated with mobi-chatGPT and impressively demonstrates one of the possibilities of generative AI.
