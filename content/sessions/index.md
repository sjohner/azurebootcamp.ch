### <a name="decentriq"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è How we Build Data Clean Rooms on Azure Confidential Computing at Decentriq
[Decentriq](https://www.decentriq.com/) is a Zurich based startup developing leading-edge data privacy products for sensitive industries. They have been awarded the startup of the year 2022 award by Microsoft.
This presentation will open with an overview of Microsoft‚Äôs confidential computing strategy and Azure's Confidential Compute offering. Decentriq will then present their confidential computing-based data collaboration platform, a deeper dive into the technology as well as use-cases of their customers ranging from banks to pharmaceutical companies.
In many cases it would be desirable to combine sensitive datasets from multiple sources to compute anonymous statistics. Examples range from healthcare research to customer analytics to anti-money laundering and marketing. However, the fact that data comes from multiple sources means that at least one party has to disclose sensitve data to another. In practice this usually means that such use-cases are blocked either for legal or lack-of-trust reasons.
Confidential computing is a CPU-rooted privacy technology that enables the processing of data while keeping the data inaccessible to all parties - including all participants, the SaaS platform and infrastructure providers. Encryption in-use enables data to stay encrypted also in memory and prevent access by the operating system. Remote attestation enables users to remotely verify that a server indeed runs in confidential computing and even what code it is running.

### <a name="quantum"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è GOD REALLY PLAYS DICE - INTRODUCTION TO QUANTUM COMPUTING WITH Q#
Quantum mechanics is one of the fundamental theories of physics, and has been tremendously successful at describing the behavior of subatomic particles. However, its counter-intuitive probabilistic nature, bizarre rules and confusing epistemology have troubled some of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, prompting Albert Einstein to remark ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt play dice‚Äù.
Today, we are at the dawn of the quantum computing age, a multidisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of physics, computer science, mathematics and chemistry and may revolutionize the technological world. In this talk, we will dive into the bizarre quantum world and explore the high-level mathematical foundations of quantum computing, quantum programming circuits and some basic ideas behind it using a new quantum programming language, Q#.   
üôÇ [FILIP WOJCIESZYN](https://www.strathweb.com/) ‚ö°Ô∏è Cloud Architect @ Sonova | Microsoft Quantum MVP

### <a name="pushingazure"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è PUSHING AZURE (DEVOPS) @ GEORG FISCHER
Tips and tricks how a small team can handle big infra and distributed system on scale.

### <a name="networkingvnext"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è AZURE NETWORKING VNEXT - HOW TO BUILD MODERN CONNECTIVITY FOR IAAS, PAAS AND SAAS
When you are working with Microsoft Azure Services you will come across the topic of Network Integration. But is a classical VPN the right solution? Do I always need ExpressRoute? Should I adopt VirtualWAN? And what about my APIs in the Cloud?
This session will help you to understand the available options to build modern Azure Networks. We will figure out how a solution-design could look like and which limitations apply. Also we will have a look into services that do not have options to integrate into a classical network and how you could mitigate this. Let's figure out how to modernize networking in Azure!

### <a name="sustainability"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è HOW CAN MICROSOFT AZURE HELP WITH SUSTAINABILITY? METHODS TO ESTIMATE YOUR CLOUD‚ÄôS CARBON FOOTPRINT
Climate change and the looming energy crisis increasingly also have an impact on IT. Apart from moral responsibility there are serious commercial forces connected to this, including rising costs and risks of business interruption as well as influences on corporate image and government regulations. Cloud computing is debated to be both a problem as well as an answer here. Therefore, it is important to consider the sustainability of Microsoft Azure.
Microsoft provides several tools to evaluate and drive sustainability aspects such as energy consumption and carbon footprint. This goes from a simple website to estimate the emission savings for Microsoft Cloud over the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft Azure in Power BI up to the Microsoft Sustainability Manager, an elaborated solution to record, report and reduce your environmental impact. Furthermore, there are external solutions such as the free and open source tool Cloud Carbon Footprint, which allows to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of cloud usage across several hyperscalers.
This talk starts with a summary about what is publicly known regarding the sustainability of the Microsoft Azure cloud in general. We then look at the different tools that are available to estimate important metrics such as carbon emissions and what their capabilities and use cases are. I‚Äôll also show limits, in particular the complexity to calculate sustainability indicators for on-premises data centers in comparison to cloud. Goal is to give you an overview at hand helping you to judge how well the Microsoft Azure cloud supports you on your way to a more sustainable future.

### <a name="powerbi"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è PUSH YOUR AZURE TENANT TO THE NEXT LEVEL WITH POWER BI
You've already heard a lot about Microsoft Power BI, but you're not sure how you can use it?
In this session I will give you an introduction of what exactly is Power BI and what you can do with it. I will demonstrate what other companies already do with it and especially how you can use it, to get the most out of your Azure tenant!  
üôÇ [DENIS SELIMOVIC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-selimovic/) ‚ö°Ô∏è Principal Consultant @ b.telligent

### <a name="azurepaas"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è AZURE PAAS, BUT AS PRIVATE AS POSSIBLE...
Azure PaaS is a great option to modernize your environment, but what happens if everything needs to be secured and the services need to be as private as possible? What is possible and where are limitations? Are there best practices and when is it necessary to change the mindset?

### <a name="landingzones"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è TAILORING LANDING ZONES TO "START SMALL AND EXPAND", BY EXAMPLE
Starting with design and implementation of the "enterprise-scale landing zone concept" from Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Adoption Framework can be overwhelming. For smaller companies it even can be seen as an "overkill". However, through tailoring the concept to the specific needs, it can be built in an agile way while still profit from the benefits.
By the example of the platform [Liiva.ch](https://liiva.ch), Lorenz Wolf will present the approach how Z√ºhlke tailored the landing zone concept to the needs of the young startup and tell about the customers journey to the Azure cloud during the initial implementation phase and public go-live of Liiva.  
üôÇ [LORENZ WOLF](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenz-wolf/) ‚ö°Ô∏è Lead Software Architect @ Z√ºhlke  

### <a name="eventdriven"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è EVENTDRIVEN SYSTEMS ON AZURE DONE RIGHT
Event-driven architectures (EDA) are becoming increasingly popular as a way to build scalable, responsive, and resilient systems.In this talk, we will explore the benefits of EDA and how to implement it on Azure. It will cover key concepts of EDA, such as Event Sourcing, CQRS, Event-based communication, event-driven data processing and its matching services on Azure (e.g. Event Grid, Event Hub, Service-Bus, Functions). Additionally, we will introduce best practices for designing, implementing and testing EDA on Azure. By the end of this talk, all attendees will have an overview of possibilities with EDAs on Azure, pitfalls and best practices related. Also they will ava a starting point to apply this knowledge to their own projects.

### <a name="dataplatform"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è FULLY AUTOMATED & CLOUD-NATIVE DATA PLATFORM
For a large insurer in Switzerland, we implemented a fully automated and cloud-native data platform using Azure and Bicep. Among other things, Azure DevOps, Azure Data Lake Storage, Azure Synapse and Databricks were used. Business stakeholders also have the ability to set up a 3-tier analytics workspace based on Azure Synapse and Azure DevOps at the click of a button and start exploring the data lake and implementing use cases. The data lake is loaded in real time via Kafka/Databricks and batch-oriented via Azure Data Factory - in total over 100 different data pipelines. These pipelines feed the core Data Warehouse, implemented with Azure Synapse.
