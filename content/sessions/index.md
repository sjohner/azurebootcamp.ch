### <a name="aziot"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è UNLOCKING THE VALUE OF AZURE IOT AND DATA ANALYTICS
Leveraging 5G connectivity and Microsoft Azure ecosystems for IoT and data analytics services is an effective means to solve business requirements. By collecting, storing, and processing data at the edge and in the cloud, companies also become more innovative and transform toward a data driven business. Customers like Rhomberg Sersa Rail Group showcase just that and more, when they embarked with us on the journey of digitizing their railway infrastructure construction sites. With that, their benefits became measurable: from increased employee safety, to reduced CO2 emissions, to financial advantages. In this session, we will take a closer look at this particular and other projects to show you how we leveraged Azure services such as IoT Edge, Stream Analytics, SQL database, Logic Apps, Service Bus and more to collect, store and process data in real-time or batch. We will also address some of our lessons learned and take a look at what the future may bring in this area.

### <a name="zerotrust"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è YOUR ZERO TRUST GAMEPLAN FOR 2022
Recent incidents have shown: An on-premises attack can affect your cloud environment too. But you still want/need to manage security for the whole picture (on-premises/Cloud/Multicloud). And if you have attended any security webinars in the last two years, it would be hard not to hear about zero trust. The fancy high-level marketing slides gave us all a nice introduction into the topic and into the Zero Trust Deployment model. You may also have heard that Zero Trust is a journey and you need to start somewhere and somehow. But where and how? None of these sessions actually provide concrete answers to these questions.This session ‚Äútries‚Äù to be different. Martin will provide a gameplan for a Zero Trust implementation. It‚Äôs time to cut some (synced) cords from onprem to make your Azure environment more secure, using divided management accounts and Microsoft security services. This session is focused on Azure Active Directory/Microsoft Security/windows-based enterprise environments.  
üôÇ [MARTIN MEYER](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-meyer832/) ‚ö°Ô∏è

### <a name="eventdriven"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è EVENT-DRIVEN APPLICATIONS IN AZURE
Using Azure, it is easier than ever to build event-driven web applications, for example using Azure Functions and the Azure SignalR service. Laurent Bugnion will show you how he implemented such a solution to solve a real-world problem. This presentation will dive into a production application called [Timekeeper](http://timekeeper.cloud), that Microsoft uses to run some of its live TV shows such as the Hello World daily show.  
üôÇ [LAURENT BUGNION](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lbugnion/) ‚ö°Ô∏è Senior Cloud Developer Advocate @ Microsoft

### <a name="aadapp"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è DEMYSTIFYING AZURE AD APPLICATIONS
Did you ever wonder what Application Registrations and Enterprise Applications in Azure AD are used for and how they work? And what the many settings are used for? No worries, these rocket-science-like objects will be discussed and explained in this session by Microsoft Regional Director and Azure MVP Marcel Zehner. He will reveal what you wanted to understand for a long time already...

### <a name="azpipelines"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è AUTOMATING MULTI STAGE AZURE PIPELINES
Engineering Teams experience toil in repeating the setup of DevOps pipelines every time a new project kicks-off within their organization. Setting up these pipelines, involve creating build definitions, release definitions, branch policies, control gates, infra as code (ARM templates), just to name a few. Imagine doing this repeatedly for every app being built within an organization. This is considerable effort spent over days.
What if this piece of development effort can be automated? How about the first push into the repository publishes an event that sets off a series of steps, constructing the total development street for your repository. This allows the developers to see their changes in minutes without looking at the nuances of setting up DevOps pipelines for creating dev, test and production infrastructure in azure.
Next to that, the engineering team can focus on topics that creates direct value for their end users.
In this talk we learn how to take advantage of Azure DevOps RESTful APIs to automate the provisioning and updating of multistage Pipelines for every repository created within an Azure DevOps Project.

### <a name="talents"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è HIRING TALENTS AND IMPACTING LIVES
Hiring talents is getting harder day by day, by 2028 the ICT industry in Switzerland will lack the expected demand for 117‚Äô000 ICT specialists. It is also estimated that there will be over 1.5 million vacant ICT jobs in the EU by 2025, which is a major market failure that will affect the economy of the region as a whole. In addition, the COVID-19 crisis has both accelerated this digitalization trend and opened up new opportunities in the field of remote working.At the same time, the lack of economic opportunities is one of many reasons for forced displacement. Vulnerable groups (mainly local youth, women, refugees, and migrants) in the MENA Region face high levels of unemployment even if they are qualified for digital jobs. As a consequence they leave their countries to secure jobs which leads to brain drain and is a hindrance to the growth of the digital economies in those countries. [Remotecoders](https://www.remotecoders.org/) is a Swiss non-profit association. It was initiated as a spin-off of Powercoders. Through this project, Remotecoders aims to address these challenges with a complementary problem: the shortage of ICT talent across Europe.
