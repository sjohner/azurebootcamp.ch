### <a name="decentriq"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è How we Build Data Clean Rooms on Azure Confidential Computing at Decentriq
[Decentriq](https://www.decentriq.com/) is a Zurich based startup developing leading-edge data privacy products for sensitive industries. They have been awarded the startup of the year 2022 award by Microsoft.
This presentation will open with an overview of Microsoft‚Äôs confidential computing strategy and Azure's Confidential Compute offering. Decentriq will then present their confidential computing-based data collaboration platform, a deeper dive into the technology as well as use-cases of their customers ranging from banks to pharmaceutical companies.
In many cases it would be desirable to combine sensitive datasets from multiple sources to compute anonymous statistics. Examples range from healthcare research to customer analytics to anti-money laundering and marketing. However, the fact that data comes from multiple sources means that at least one party has to disclose sensitve data to another. In practice this usually means that such use-cases are blocked either for legal or lack-of-trust reasons.
Confidential computing is a CPU-rooted privacy technology that enables the processing of data while keeping the data inaccessible to all parties - including all participants, the SaaS platform and infrastructure providers. Encryption in-use enables data to stay encrypted also in memory and prevent access by the operating system. Remote attestation enables users to remotely verify that a server indeed runs in confidential computing and even what code it is running.

### <a name="lakehouse"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è Building a Lakehouse Platform on Azure with Databricks
In this talk, we will introduce Hadron, a project that involves building a new platform for die Mobiliar to run all BI, ML, Analytics, and AI workloads. The platform is built on the Lakehouse architecture from Databricks and hosted on Azure. We use multiple Databricks Workspaces and UnityCatalog from Databricks. Our project needs to adhere to the pre-defined cloud architecture for application deployment on Azure within our company. The data on the platform is organized using the DataMesh/DataProduct approach. We began the project in February 2022 and have made significant progress in building the infrastructure, allowing for large-scale data products to be deployed on the platform.

Our talk will cover the following topics:
1. Introduction: We'll discuss our goals for the new platform and why we chose the Databricks Lakehouse approach.
2. The key components of the Lakehouse architecture: Unity Catalog, Databricks Workspaces, and how access control is managed.
3. Overview of the cloud architecture within our company and how it informs the infrastructure of the platform.
4. Infrastructure overview: how we organize Databricks Workspaces, Azure Data Lake Storages, and how the storage is networked with the workspaces to ensure secure access.
5. Automation: We'll explain how we use GitLab Pipelines and Terraform, as well as Databricks APIs, to automate the deployment of resources and manage access controls.
6. Key decisions made during the architecture design and why they were important.
7. Challenges we encountered during the project and how we overcame them.
8. Current status of the infrastructure: what data is available and who is currently using the platform.
9. Next steps: where we plan to go from here.

### <a name="quantum"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è God really plays dice - Introduction to quantum computing with Q#
Quantum mechanics is one of the fundamental theories of physics, and has been tremendously successful at describing the behavior of subatomic particles. However, its counter-intuitive probabilistic nature, bizarre rules and confusing epistemology have troubled some of the greatest physicists of the 20th century, prompting Albert Einstein to remark ‚ÄúGod doesn‚Äôt play dice‚Äù.
Today, we are at the dawn of the quantum computing age, a multidisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of physics, computer science, mathematics and chemistry and may revolutionize the technological world. In this talk, we will dive into the bizarre quantum world and explore the high-level mathematical foundations of quantum computing, quantum programming circuits and some basic ideas behind it using a new quantum programming language, Q#.

### <a name="sustainability"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è How can Microsoft Azure help with sustainability? Methods to estimate your cloud‚Äôs carbon footprint
Climate change and the looming energy crisis increasingly also have an impact on IT. Apart from moral responsibility there are serious commercial forces connected to this, including rising costs and risks of business interruption as well as influences on corporate image and government regulations. Cloud computing is debated to be both a problem as well as an answer here. Therefore, it is important to consider the sustainability of Microsoft Azure.
Microsoft provides several tools to evaluate and drive sustainability aspects such as energy consumption and carbon footprint. This goes from a simple website to estimate the emission savings for Microsoft Cloud over the Emissions Impact Dashboard for Microsoft Azure in Power BI up to the Microsoft Sustainability Manager, an elaborated solution to record, report and reduce your environmental impact. Furthermore, there are external solutions such as the free and open source tool Cloud Carbon Footprint, which allows to estimate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of cloud usage across several hyperscalers.
This talk starts with a summary about what is publicly known regarding the sustainability of the Microsoft Azure cloud in general. We then look at the different tools that are available to estimate important metrics such as carbon emissions and what their capabilities and use cases are. I‚Äôll also show limits, in particular the complexity to calculate sustainability indicators for on-premises data centers in comparison to cloud. Goal is to give you an overview at hand helping you to judge how well the Microsoft Azure cloud supports you on your way to a more sustainable future.

### <a name="landingzones"></a> ‚≠êÔ∏è Tailoring landing zones to "start small and expand", by example
Starting with design and implementation of the "enterprise-scale landing zone concept" from Microsoft‚Äôs Cloud Adoption Framework can be overwhelming. For smaller companies it even can be seen as an "overkill". However, through tailoring the concept to the specific needs, it can be built in an agile way while still profit from the benefits.
By the example of the platform [Liiva.ch](https://liiva.ch), Lorenz Wolf will present the approach how Z√ºhlke tailored the landing zone concept to the needs of the young startup and tell about the customers journey to the Azure cloud during the initial implementation phase and public go-live of Liiva.
